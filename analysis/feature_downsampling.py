    statistic: "mean" | "median"
        How to summarize the resulting rho values.

    Notes
    -----
    This is equivalent to calculating U / abs(y1*y2), where `y1` and `y2` are the subgroup sizes,
    and U is the Mann-Whitney U, and is also sometimes referred to as Herrnstein's rho [1] or "f",
    the "common-language effect size" [2].

    Note we also *must* rescale due to the implicit different units of each feature. E.g. as rho
    is implicity "signed", with values above 0.5 indicating separation in one
    direction, and values below 0.5 indicating separation in the other, taking a mean or median can
    be deeply misleading if some features result in rho values close to 1, and others have rho
    values close to zero.

    Notes
    -----
    Finding a measure to convey the distance of two subgroups given multiple features is essentially
    a search for a cluster similarity / distance metric. If we replace subgroups with their mean
    vectors (or median vectors), then we can use a number of natural multi-dimensional distance
    measures. However, only a few of these take into account variance and/or overlap. Using
    Mahalanobis distance on the subgroup means/medians has this partial advantage (naturally
    rescales the data). Otherwise, data could be feature-wise centered and then standard distance
    metrics used.
